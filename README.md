## Notes
#### [Interview Evaluations](https://youtu.be/jxAWQN5t6wg)
* Goal is to see how you think & learn about the candidate as a software engineer.
* Doesn't have to be perfect code, but should be roughly correct.
  * Stuff like putting .size() instead of .length() is probably not a big deal.
  * Stuff like using == instead of = is concerning.
* Communicate thought process as much as possible.
  * Just keep talking, even if it's just mumbling it gives a better idea of what's going on in your head than sitting there silently.
